# Helium (really stupid fork edition)
this is a fork of helium that literally just replaces device temperature with a giant ascii trollface

Status Bar Widgets for TrollStore iPhones on iOS 15+. Works on Jailbroken devices as well.

More widgets to come in future updates!

## Building
[Theos](https://theos.dev) is required to compile the app. The SDK used is iOS 15.0, but you can use any SDK you want.
To change the SDK, go to the `Makefile` and modify the `TARGET` to your SDK version:
```
TARGET := iphone:clang:[SDK Version]:[Minimum Version]
```
Run `./ipabuild.sh` to build the ipa. The resulting tipa should be in a folder called 'build'.

## Tested Devices
- iPhone 13 Pro (iOS 15.3.1)
- iPhone X (iOS 16.1.1, Jailbroken)

## Known Issues
- It currently does not adapt to the color of the status bar (it will always be white).
- Scaling is incorrect and you can only add a max of 1 widget on home button devices.
